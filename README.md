## Introduction

This project installs Home Automation Bus (openHAB) project and Java Library on Resin.io.

This is a very simple project that is an example derived from Hello-Java (https://github.com/nghiant2710/Hello-Java) of how to run Java code on a Raspberry Pi.

The open Home Automation Bus (openHAB) project aims at providing a universal integration platform for all things around home automation. It is a pure Java solution, fully based on OSGi. The Equinox OSGi runtime and Jetty as a web server build the core foundation of the runtime.
